## About Me

I am a rising senior at Rhodes College in Memphis, TN. I'll be graduating in May 2022 with a BS in Computer Science and a BA in Greek and Roman studies. Previously, my research has focused on trust and privacy in human-robot interaction.

## About My Mentor

My mentor is [Dr. Julia Hockenmaier](http://juliahmr.cs.illinois.edu/) at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. Her primary research area is Natural Language Processing.

## About My Project

I plan to expand on Dr. Hockenmaier's previous research, the goal of which is to eventually develop fully interactive agents that can work with humans to complete a task. The specific scenario we are looking at is a collaborative building task in Minecraft. I'll be working on generating building instructions; as of now, these instructions are block-by-block, but I plan to create more complex instructions that deal with shapes and substructures.
