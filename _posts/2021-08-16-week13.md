title: Week 13

So this is my last week! I've mostly been working on writing my final report, cleaning up the documentation, and creating instructions on how to run my code. I've also added some more paramters to my program - a start seed, end seed, and builder position seed. Previously, there was only one parameter for the seed. Dialogues created for the same target structure on different seeds would not have the same world states, because the builder's position was also randomized. Now, the builder's position is determined by a separate seed. If the builder's seed is kept stable while the other seed is changed, paraphrased dialogues will be generated for the same target structures.

I've also tried to begin working on training a Builder model on my data, but I've unfortunately run out of time. This will have to be left to future work. I've really enjoyed the whole experience! It was my first time doing NLP anything, and I think I'd like to study this field more in the future.
