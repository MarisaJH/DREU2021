This past week I have been working on generating some datasets that we can use to train the Architect and Builder models. First I made a small dataset with 1000 structures. Since that didn't take too long, I also generated a larger dataset with 10,000 target structures. We did discover just recently that my program wasn't generating all the files we will need to train the models. It's a simple fix, but I'll have to re-generate this data after I apply that fix.

I have also started collecting example figures for my final report. I have a comparison of an example dialogue and its corresponding 3d plot, and a comparison of the same dialogue on two different seeds. I'm also planning on getting some figures that illustrate the different build orders for rows and planes.
