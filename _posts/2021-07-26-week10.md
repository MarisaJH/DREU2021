This week, I've been working on generating new build orders for rows and planes. Rows are easy - just choose whichever end is closer to the last block placed, and reverse the order of the blocks if necessary.

Planes are a bit more difficult. At first, the build orders I generated for planes was similar to the way water would fill a box; it would start at a corner and then fill up the bottom and the neighbor blocks. But my mentor thought that even if this build order was optimal, it wasn't how actual people tend to build planes. We looked at some data and found that people build planes row-by-row or column-by-column, and sometimes they zigzag (change which edge they start building from on each new row). So I've started working on implementing this behavior, but it's not finished yet.
