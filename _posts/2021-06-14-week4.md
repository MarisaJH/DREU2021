I've finally made a very basic (but working!) program. Given a set of shapes, it outputs instructions on how to build those shapes in this format: [make/build/create] a [color] [shape].  
The next steps are to add some more information, like the dimensions and orientation of the shape, and to create more varied sentence templates.
