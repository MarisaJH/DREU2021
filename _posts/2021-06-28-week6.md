This week I incorporated the orientations of the shapes into the sentence templates. I also reorganized the sentence templates by shape type - whether the shape is the first shape being built and what dimensions it has.

I also discovered a bug where on some seeds, my whole program would crash... that's fixed though! It was a divide by zero error.

The next steps are to do a little more refinement by adding some more variance and new templates. I also want to add which direction a shape should be built in; for example, should a horizontal row be built side-to-side (left or right) or front-to-back? This should be similar to what I was doing with the shape orientations.
